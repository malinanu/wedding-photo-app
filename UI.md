üé® Color Palette
A limited, sophisticated color palette makes the UI feel clean and refined.

Primary Accent: A muted gold or warm gray ($#C2B280$ or $#808080$). This color is used sparingly for buttons and key accents.

Secondary: A very light gray ($#F5F5F5$) or off-white for backgrounds.

Text: A dark, almost black gray ($#333333$) for readability.

Subtle Accent: A single, light tone of the primary accent color ($#E7E1CC$ or a similar light warm gray) for hover effects or subtle background elements.

‚úíÔ∏è Typography
Use a classic, clean font pair to convey elegance.

Headings: A serif font like Playfair Display or Lora for a traditional, sophisticated feel.

Body Text: A clean, highly readable sans-serif font like Poppins or Inter for all other text.

‚ú® UI Components and Flow
1. Welcome & Authentication Screen
The first screen a guest sees after scanning the QR code should be simple and inviting.

Background: A light, soft-textured background.

Title: Large, centered text, "Welcome to [Event Name]'s Gallery." Below that, a smaller subtitle, "Please enter your name to start uploading."

Input Field: A single, clean input field labeled "Your Name." It has a subtle border that changes to the primary accent color on focus.

Button: A large, prominent button labeled "Continue" or "Let's Go!" using the primary accent color. It should have a soft shadow and a subtle hover effect.

2. Upload Interface
This is the main screen for guest interaction, so it must be intuitive and focused.

Header: A simple header that says "Upload Photos." Consider a small, subtle icon like a camera emoji or a heart.

Main Call to Action: A massive, central button that dominates the screen. It should be a soft square or circle with a camera icon (üì∏) and the text "Tap to Upload." The button should use the primary accent color and have a subtle shadow.

Status Indicators:

On tap: The button text can change to "Selecting..." or a loading spinner can appear next to it.

Uploading: A preview thumbnail of each selected photo appears in a grid below the main button.

A clean, thin progress bar appears beneath each thumbnail, using the primary accent color.

The status text "Uploading..." is shown next to the thumbnail.

Completed: The progress bar disappears, and a small, celebratory icon like a checkmark (‚úÖ) or confetti (üéâ) appears on the thumbnail. The status text changes to "Uploaded."

3. "Your Uploads" Gallery
This section provides immediate feedback and shows guests what they have contributed.

Title: A small, bold heading "Your Photos."

Layout: Photos are displayed in a clean, minimalist grid. Each image has a slight padding and rounded corners.

Functionality: Guests can tap a photo to see a larger view, but the primary focus remains on the upload function.

üí° Key Design Principles
Minimalism: Remove anything that doesn't serve a clear purpose. No sidebars, no complex menus. The user flow is linear and simple.

High Contrast: Use the dark gray text on a light background to ensure maximum readability.

Visual Hierarchy: The most important element on each screen (e.g., the "Continue" button, the "Tap to Upload" button) is the largest and most visually distinct.

Animation: Use subtle, smooth animations for transitions and feedback (e.g., button presses, progress bar fills) to make the experience feel more responsive and premium.
